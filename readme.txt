
- run.m is a basic test file that generates a set of data points and computes their quasi-geometric means

- File gen_fig# generates the figure number # of the paper.

- The seed of the random generator when generating the figures of the paper is recorded in the Random_generator.mat file.

- The KarcherMean folder contains the codes of the paper: 

	"A Riemannian Limited-Memory BFGS Algorithm for Computing the Matrix Geometric Mean", 
	by Yuan, Huang, Absil and Gallivan.

  and is used for the LRBFGS implementation.

- All other method's implementations are in the "methods" folder.
